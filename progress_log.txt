Project report 1.  16.3.2021

Project has been started and some classes has been added. Project has Game class, GameApp(GUI)
World class, GameObject class, Enemy class and Tower class. Last three classes have also subclasses
in them. Enemy has update method kinda working, World class can read and create a map from file and
it has been kinda tested to work right.

GUI draws a map and moving enemies can be added to it and some buttons etc has been added but nothing
final. I had a lot of difficulties with animating enemies but it has been implemented now. 
The way I animate everything in this game is not really efficient but oh well this is the only 
way I can do it at the moment. 

I have worked like 20 or more hours with this. (A lot of learning and reading). 
I think I am a little bit ahead of my planned schedule but I still have a lot of work ahead.
