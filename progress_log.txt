Project report 1.  16.3.2021

Project has been started and some classes has been added. Project has Game class, GameApp(GUI)
World class, GameObject class, Enemy class and Tower class. Last three classes have also subclasses
in them. Enemy has update method kinda working, World class can read and create a map from file and
it has been kinda tested to work right.

GUI draws a map and moving enemies can be added to it and some buttons etc has been added but nothing
final. I had a lot of difficulties with animating enemies but it has been implemented now. 
The way I animate everything in this game is not really efficient but oh well this is the only 
way I can do it at the moment. 

I have worked like 20 or more hours with this. (A lot of learning and reading). 
I think I am a little bit ahead of my planned schedule but I still have a lot of work ahead. 






Project report 2. 30.3.2021 

Towers shoot enemies in range and can destroy them. Towers also can be added to the GUI by 
pressing a button saying the type of the tower and writing coordinates to a popup screen.
Towers shoot projectiles and they move towards targeted enemy and then dissapear when they are close enough.
Projectile does not look good in GUI and leaves some trails in the map but they still look kinda like
projectiles.  

I added a seperate timer to spawn enemies and now it spawn them at predefined rate. This lags the game
a bit but i am trying to optimize it. GUI has 2 buttons for towers one is for normalTower and the other
is for a new RangeTower which I added. I have tested a lot of methods with unit test along the way and 
it helped me with some bugs. There is still some bugs like the movement of projectiles and the fact that
they do not dissappear fully. 

This game will probably have a really rough GUI implementation. I worked about 15 to 20 hours. I hope that 
these next 2 weeks i will be able to finish this and then focus on cleaning the code and documentation.




Project report 3. 13.4.2021

I added 2 new enemies and towers to the game. I also changed and tested the projectile movement. I added 
new buttons for GUI so different towers can be added with seperate buttons. I finished the waveGenerator 
and now it reads the correct enemies from file and creates waves for them. Game checks if there is a wave file 
given and spawns given enemies. If there is no file, game just spawns easyEnemies infinitely. I also added 
few popup for different situations i.e when player does not have enough money. And if player loses 
there is a game over popup.

The game is almost ready. There is a lot of cleaning the code and testing different situations still. 
I could not get the waves to come in with delay but it does not affect the gameplay. I have no idea how 
much I worked this time. Probably about the same 15-20 hours. There is some bad implementations i.e 
placing towers to GUI, in my game but I probably wont have enough time to learn better ones.
